# HANA Instance Management (Draft)

## 1. Purpose

At SAP Signavio, we aim to make SAP HANA Cloud a core part of our technology infrastructure. To seamlessly integrate it with Signavio’s systems and applications, we provide support for managing SAP HANA Cloud instances. This support is designed to simplify operational tasks throughout an application's lifecycle and ensure compliance with product standards and audit requirements.

## 2. Application Lifecycle

Managing an application involves various tasks, some handled by delivery teams and others by the CloudOS Database team.
